# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository documents my **DSA learning journey** and the problems Iâ€™ve practiced to strengthen my problem-solving skills.  
I have organized the study plan into three main phases:

### ðŸ“Œ Phase 1: Foundations
- Arrays  
- Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Recursion  

### ðŸ“Œ Phase 2: Intermediate Concepts
- Sorting Algorithms  
- Hash Tables  
- Stacks  
- Queues  

### ðŸ“Œ Phase 3: Advanced Concepts
- Graphs  
- Heaps  
- Trees  
- Tries  

---

### ðŸŒ± Learning Journey
At first, I found it challenging to understand the logic behind DSA.  
Through **consistent practice and problem-solving**, I have gradually improved and developed confidence in applying DSA to coding challenges.  

This repo will continue to grow as I progress in my DSA journey ðŸš€
